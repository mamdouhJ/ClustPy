def cvnn_score(X: np.ndarray, labels: np.ndarray | int | tuple, n_neighbors: int = 5, metric: str = "euclidean") -> float | np.ndarray:
    """
    Evaluate the quality of predicted labels by computing the clustering validation index based on nearest neighbors (CVNN).
    The score is calculated by adding a nearest-neighbor-based cluster separation value with a cluster compactness vale based on inner-cluster distances.
    Usually, it is used with a list of label arrays, i.e., labels is of type list or tuple.
    In this case, the score will be normalized to a value within [0, 2].
    If labels is a single array (of type np.ndarray) a single score is returned that is not normalized.
    In both cases, a lower value indicates a better clustering result (less neighbors in separate clusters and lower inner-cluster distances).

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : np.ndarray
        The data set
    labels : np.ndarray | list | tuple
        The labels as predicted by a clustering algorithm. If labels is a list/tuple it should contain multiple labels arrays of type np.ndarray
    n_neighbors : int
        The amount of neighbors to consider when calculating the cluster separation score. An object is not considered its own neighbor (default: 5)
    metric : str
        The metric used to identify the neighbors and to calculate the inner-cluster distance.
        See scipy.spatial.distance.pdist for more information (default: 'euclidean')

    Returns
    -------
    cvnn : float | np.ndarray
        The cvnn score of type float if labels contains a single labels array, i.e., labels is of type np.ndarray.
        Alternatively, a np.ndarray containing the normalized cvnn scores.
